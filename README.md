# Number Guessig Game
Fun project

This is a program tht generates a random number and asks the player to guess it. If the player guess higher number than the actual number the program displays "Lower number please". Similarly if the player guess the lower number, the program prints "higher number please".
When the player guess the correct number, the program displays the number of guesses the player used to arrive at the number.
